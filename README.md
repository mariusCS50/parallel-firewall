# Parallel Firewall

This project implements a parallel firewall designed as a university assignment. It features a multithreaded design where a single producer thread generates packets and multiple consumer threads process them. The consumers use a shared circular buffer (ring buffer) to retrieve packets without busy waiting. The result of the processing is logged in a structured log file with PASS/DROP decisions.

## Features

- **Multithreading & Synchronization**
  - A single **producer** thread (implemented in [src/producer.c](src/producer.c)) inserts packets into a shared ring buffer.
  - Multiple **consumer** threads (implemented in [src/consumer.c](src/consumer.c)) process packets concurrently using proper notification mechanisms for synchronization.

- **Shared Data Structure**
  - The circular buffer is implemented in [src/ring_buffer.c](src/ring_buffer.c) and its header in [src/ring_buffer.h](src/ring_buffer.h), ensuring efficient packet distribution.

- **Serial & Parallel Implementations**
  - Besides the parallel firewall version, a serial implementation is provided in [src/serial.c](src/serial.c) for baseline testing and comparison.

- **Logging**
  - The results (including packet hash, processing decision, timestamps, etc.) are recorded via functions in the utilities ([utils/log/utils.h](utils/log/utils.h) and corresponding source files), ensuring a verifiable audit trail of the firewall operations.

- **Automated Building and Testing**
  - Build the project with a Makefile in the [src](src) directory.
  - Automated tests are provided in the [tests](tests) directory that generate test packets and compare outputs against a reference execution.
  - A checker script ([checker/checker.sh](checker/checker.sh)) and a Docker-based local testing environment (managed with [local.sh](local.sh)) ensure a consistent grading process.

## Building the Project

There are several ways to compile and run the firewall:

### Building the Firewall and Serial Implementations

1. Change to the `src` directory:

```bash
cd src
make
```

This will compile both the parallel firewall executable (typically named `firewall`) and the serial version of the application.

### Running Automated Tests

From the [`tests`](tests) directory you can run the grading and testing scripts:

```bash
cd tests
./grade.sh
```

This process runs test cases using different numbers of threads and validates both correctness and logging output.

### Docker Integration and the Checker

A Docker-based testing environment is provided to ensure a consistent build and test setup:

- **Build the Docker Image:**

```bash
./local.sh docker build
```

- **Run the Checker:**

```bash
./local.sh checker
```

The scripts in [`local.sh`](local.sh) and the Docker configuration (Dockerfile) automatically package the project and run the necessary tests and linters in a container.

## Implementation Details

- **Directory Structure:**
  - **[`src`](src):** Core implementation including:
    - producer.c and producer.h: Producer thread logic.
    - consumer.c and consumer.h: Consumer thread functions.
    - packet.c and packet.h: Packet structure and related utilities.
    - ring_buffer.c and ring_buffer.h: Circular buffer implementation.
    - serial.c: Serial firewall version for baseline comparison.
    - firewall.c: Contains components specific to the firewall execution.
  - **[`tests`](tests):** Automated tests and scripts like checker.py and grade.sh.
  - **[`checker`](checker):** High-level checker script (checker.sh) used by Docker and for local runs.
  - **local.sh:** Shell script managing Docker builds, testing, and image pushing.
  - **[`utils`](utils):** Utility functions for logging and debugging (e.g., utils/log/utils.h).

- **Synchronization & Efficiency:**
  Consumer threads are required not to use busy waiting. Instead, they must be notified of new packets arriving in the ring buffer. This design is a key part of the assignment that encourages proper synchronization primitives usage.

- **Testing & Validation:**
  The automated testing suite generates multiple test cases with varying packet sizes and thread configurations. The comparison between the serial and parallel implementations ensures that the firewallâ€™s behavior remains consistent regardless of concurrency.

## Example Workflow

1. **Build the Project:**

	```bash
	cd src
	make
	```

2. **Run the Automated Tests:**

	```bash
	cd tests
	./grade.sh
	```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Checker:**

	```bash
	./local.sh docker build
	./local.sh checker
	```

4. **Fast Run Automated Tests and Grade (no linter, no prebuilds)**:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   make check
   ```
